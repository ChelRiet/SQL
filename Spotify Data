/*In this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle. I then created a table in SQLite Studio to insert the data into. Finally I ran a few queries to understand the data more*/

/*Creating the table:*/ 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

/*I then inserted the data's .csv file into the table*/

/*The following is SQL I used to gain insights into the data*/

/*1. First I wanted to know what the top 10 most popular songs and which artist made them were.*/
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

/*2. I also wanted to see which song out of all the data has the longest play time.*/
SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc
LIMIT 1;

/*3. I then wanted to calculate the average danceability of the top 10 popular songs.*/
SELECT AVG(danceability) AS topten_avg_danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity IN (SELECT popularity
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
  ORDER BY popularity DESC
  LIMIT 10);
